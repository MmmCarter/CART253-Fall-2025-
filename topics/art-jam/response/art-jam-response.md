From the moment I first saw it, I was immediately drawn to the eye—even without any interaction, its rhythmic blinking instantly brought this static piece to life. Changes of the background colors as the eye moves (mouseIsMoving function) shows different levels of depth and sensation, which let the “self-portraits” become more about exploring one's emotions and state of mind. It creates a sense of “aliveness” in self-expression, making viewers feel as though they are both observing and “operating” a part of Joyce herself.

In the code, the facial construction avoids complex composite graphic combinations, achieving a remarkably polished effect through simple shapes and parameters. Every functions and variables is very clear and well organized. The eye blinking function (line 78 - 83) is undoubtedly the soul of this work. 

Overall, this is a creative and distinctive interactive piece. I absolutely love this free-spirited and ever-changing form of expression.
