From the moment I first saw it, I was immediately drawn to the eye—even without any interaction, its rhythmic blinking instantly brought this static piece to life. Changes of the background colors as the eye moves (mouseIsMoving function) shows different levels of depth and sensation, which let the “self-portraits” become more about exploring one's emotions and state of mind. It creates a sense of “aliveness” in self-expression, making viewers feel as though they are both observing and “operating” a part of Joyce herself.

In the code, the facial construction avoids complex composite graphic combinations, achieving a remarkably polished effect through simple shapes and parameters. Every functions and variables is very clear and well organized. The eye blinking function (line 78 - 83) is undoubtedly the soul of this work. 

Overall, this is a creative and distinctive interactive piece. I absolutely love this free-spirited and ever-changing form of expression.

Upon opening this piece, I was immediately captivated by its mysteriously evocative visual atmosphere. The interplay of light and shadow, the interweaving of geometric forms and soft curves, seemed to beckon the viewer into the depths of consciousness. The heart-shaped pupils and the two patterns spinning at different speeds behind it gave me a profoundly mysterious and psychedelic sensation. The name “Window To The Soul” perfectly captures the essence of this work.

In Anthony's code, he put numerous random variables to determine the colors of the eyelids, eyeballs, and background, using mousePressed () and mouseClicked () to make every operation delivers a unique visual shock. All parameters in draw () are all extremely detailed. The blinking of the eyelids adds realism to the work (line 194 - 198).

I love this work so much that I've come up with some ideas for expanding it: If this eye could be paired with half a face, maybe it will become an more fantastical work.
