# Mod Jam Ideas

1. Increase in fly population. (After eating a certain number of flies, the number of flies appearing on the screen at the same time will increase.)

2. Fly becoming smaller in size. (Same as above, but maybe lower limit? (size needs to be visible))

3. Anger Mode (If fail to hit the fly three times in a row, the frog will become angry and turn red, the tongue will be 5 times wider in the next hit.)

4. Scoring System (Hit one for 1 point, two in a row for 3 points, three in a row for 5 points. Consecutive hits after will keep getting 5 points.)

5. Penalty Mechanism (Deduct 2 points for missing three attacks in a row.(Can be interact with anger mode maybe?))

6. Health System (The flies were furious and decide to fight back. Stop them before they come at you.(Lose health when being hit by a fly))

7. Ability (Give the frog some cool spells to make him eating more enjoyable? Spells will have CDs)

8. Fly spawning location (No longer appearing only from the left; it can appear from any position on the screen.)

9. Fly moving path (Moves up and down instead of only flying straight)

10. Fly moving speed (Fly's moving speed is not stable, sometimes fast, sometimes slow)
