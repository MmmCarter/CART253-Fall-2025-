# Mod Jam Ideas

1. Increase in fly population. (After eating a certain number of flies, the number of flies appearing on the screen at the same time will increase.)

2. Fly becoming smaller in size. (Same as above, but maybe lower limit? (size needs to be visible))

3. Anger Mode (If fail to hit the fly three times in a row, the frog will become angry and turn red, the tongue will be 5 times wider in the next hit.)

4. Scoring System (Hit one for 1 point, two in a row for 3 points, three in a row for 5 points. Consecutive hits after will keep getting 5 points.)

5. Penalty Mechanism (Deduct 2 points for missing three attacks in a row.(Can be interact with anger mode maybe?))
