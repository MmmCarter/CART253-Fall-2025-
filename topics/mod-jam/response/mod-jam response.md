This is a very interesting game. The title page is simple and clear, I immediately understood what I needed to pay attention to in the game after just a  quick glance. The overall visual effects are creative, the frog and the fly seem to have switched roles, the attack pattern has also changed from the conventional tongue-flicking to a forward lunge, which is really fun. Despite some flaws in the countdown timer, it's still a pretty good one (When my first attempt was about to end in failure, yet the timer turned negative and kept running, that moment brought me a profound sense of redemption lol).

This game is very well-designed! The title screen, backgrounds, and models are all outstanding (I'm really partial to this pixel art style). But even in pixel art, you can still found those exquisitely crafted details such as the "golden truthful prophecies". The game consists of two mini-games, each with its own unique style, and the instructions are very clear as well, when I was playing with it, I really gives me the feel about playing Gameboys when I was a kid. If BGM and some game sound effects could be added, this would absolutely be a legend!
