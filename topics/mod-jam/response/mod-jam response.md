This is a very interesting game. The title page is simple and clear, I immediately understood what I needed to pay attention to in the game after just a  quick glance. The overall visual effects are creative, the frog and the fly seem to have switched roles, the attack pattern has also changed from the conventional tongue-flicking to a forward lunge, which is really fun. Despite some flaws in the countdown timer, it's still a pretty good one! (When my first attempt was about to end in failure, yet the timer turned negative and kept running, that moment brought me a profound sense of redemption lol)

This game is very well-designed! The title screen, backgrounds, and models are all outstanding (I'm really partial to this pixel art style). But even in pixel art, you can still found those exquisitely crafted details such as the "golden truthful prophecies". The game consists of two mini-games, each with its own unique style, and the instructions are very clear as well, when I was playing with it, I really gives me the feel about playing Gameboys when I was a kid. If BGM and some game sound effects could be added, this would absolutely be a legend!

When I first start this game, I really like the method of starting the game by eating a fly in the title page is incredibly creative. The gameplay where the wood frog moves forward after eating flies and bugs also strikes me as quite fun, especially the one that looks like a bee or a moth - its moving track are brilliantly designed, lots of my attacks were rhythmically dodged. In addition, the educational section about the wood frog in the victory screen is also exceptionally wee-designed, now I've really gained some understanding about the wood frog! Good work!
